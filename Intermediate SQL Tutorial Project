Intermediate SQL Tutorial Project

Project Overview:
This project is an intermediate guide to SQL, where I practiced several important functions and commands. The goal of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of SQL operations for sorting, aggregating, and analyzing data. I was given various questions, which I solved using these SQL functions and commands.

Key SQL Functions and Commands

ORDER BY (ASC):
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending order (ASC) by one or more columns.

The ORDER BY clause can also sort the result set in descending order (DESC).

SUM:
The SUM function calculates the total sum of a numeric column.

AVERAGE:
